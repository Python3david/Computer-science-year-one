# Timer Simulation Program Starter

# 1. Ask the user how many seconds to count
count_limit = int(input("Enter the number of seconds for your timer: "))

# 2. Define a function to display the countdown
def countdown(second):
    print(f"Time: {second} second(s)")

# 3. Use a loop to simulate the countdown
for second in range("input", count_limit - 1):
    countdown(second)

# Optional Challenge:
# Add a message at the end: "Time's up!"
